## Welcome To This Hands-on Lab 👋🏽
This is a **4-hour** instructor-led workshop session at Microsoft Ignite 2025. By the end of this lab you should know how to go from model selection to model customization and deployment - and use the end-to-end observability features in Azure AI Foundry to evaluate, trace, and monitor, your agentic AI applications.

## 1. Lab Instructions

**Project Repo:** ++https://aka.ms/ignite25/preday++

The lab guide and code exercises are available in the repository above. To get started, open a new private browser in your workstation. :

1. To get started, head over tho ++https://aka.ms/ignite25/PREL13++
1. Log into GitHub with a personal profile - create one if needed.
1. Wait till Codespaces is ready - you should see an active VS Code terminal.
1. Run this command in terminal - ++mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &++
1. Confirm "open in browser" pop-up - you will see an interactive guide in the browser!
1. Leave this browser open and follow the instructions in that guide.


## 2. Azure Credentials

You will be assigned a temporary Azure subscription for this lab. Verify that the _Username_ and _Password_ credentials are not empty below. We will use them during setup.

- **Username:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Username++
- **Password:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).Password++
- **TAP Token:** ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(User1).AccessToken++

## 3. Skillable VM Credentials

The Skillable VM has a login screen (left) that we do **NOT** need to use today. However, we may need it for troubleshooting (with proctor help). The credentials below will be useful for logging in then.

- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Username+++
- +++@lab.VirtualMachine(WRK550-Win11(NEW)).Password+++

## 4. Time Tracking

This Skillable page has a countdown timer (top right) that will show **Hours Remaining** for lab completion. Use this to track time left and decide if you want to do optional steps accordingly. 

- You should start with at least 1h 15min on the clock.
- You will be notified when there are 10 mins left
- When timer expires, the VM will terminate automatically!
 
## 5. Revisiting Lab at Home

By the end of this workshop, you will have a copy of the sample app in your personal GitHub profile. Revisit it at home to explore and complete sections at your own pace. 

1. You will need your own Azure subscription for this.
1. You will need to set the "Before You Begin" tab to **Self-Guided** 
1. Then continue working through the lab steps there.
